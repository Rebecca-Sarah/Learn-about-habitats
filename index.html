            <h2> What are habitats? </h2>
            <p> A habitat is a place where different animals, plants and other living things make it their
                home. There
                are many different aspects that make up the perfect habitat for different living species.

                Animals rely on their habitat for food, shelter and being able to mate. It is important that the
                habitats are protected as the animals have evolved to have adapted to their surroundings. When the
                environment changes or gets destroyed that will mean the animals are more likely to suffer and may end
                in extinction as they may not be able to survive elsewhere.

                Plants have many different needs including light, air water and soil which is provided for them
                depending on where they originate from. They are dependent on their surroundings making it vital that
                they are protected, especially due to increasing concerns about global warming and how that will affect
                different habitats and eco-systems.

            <h2> How we can protect them?</h2>
            <p>Global warming is a huge threat to habitats all around the world, luckily there are many small steps
                people
                can take to slow down the affects and speed at which it can happen, these include recycling as much as
                possible, walking or cycling instead of driving, try and avoid using single use plastic, and by checking
                your tyres on the car to ensure they are in good conditions as this will ensure fuel is being used to
                the
                maximum. There are also many things that can be done to help protect and even restore ecosystems,
                examples
                including planting trees, plants and different shrubs that provide food, shelter and water to a variety
                of
                different animals and insects. Introduce more wild gardens and wild flower areas in public spaces and in
                private, this can be done by growing natural grass instead of installing artificial grass and planting
                more
                wild flowers. </p>
