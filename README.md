## User Experience
### Site Structure 
Protect Our Habitats is a three page website with the pages about, habitats and contact us for the user to navigate around. The user will be brought straight onto the about page and will see links to the other two pages in the navigation bar that is in the header. 

### Design Choices
- Font
The main font that was chosen was Nunito which was used throughout all three pages of the website with sans-serif as a second choice. Keeping the same font for all the text keeps the theme of continuity which is bettter for the users experience when visiting the site. 
Most of the text used is the same weight to continue the pages blending well together, with the headings for the paragraphs being a larger size to ensure the user knows what the main objective for the paragraph is. 

- Colour Scheme 
The colour scheme chosen to be was based off using green and white tones, using a dark green, a sage colour and white. These colours are meant to give off the feel of being outside with nature to bring the user closer to Protect Our Habitats.

  - Under the heading bar on each page are four different photographs of four different habitats found around the world.

- About
  - The About page is broken into two sections with two different paragraphs with a question as a heading which allows the user to effectively see what the paragraph is about. The two sections are clearly split, one has a white background and the other a dark green to allow the user an easy reading experience as well as breaking the page up nicely. 

- Habitats 
  - Habitats has four seperate elements within the page that outline and detail what four different habitats are and how they can be protected. They are split like the About page with the first element having a white background and green writing, the second having a green background with white writing with the last two following the pattern. This keep the website flowing throughout all pages and makes for a better user experience. 
  - Two videos were added to this page within the boxes for the African Savanna and the Arctic which allows users to listen to more information about those habitats as well as reading what is written above. The videos do not automatically play to ensure the user experience is relaxing and can play the videos when they are ready. 
- Contact Us
  - A form is situated in the middle of the page with two different sides, on the left there is a picture which draws the user in to the form which shows a forest that links into the theme of the website and the colours used throughout the Protect Our Habitats website.
  - The border around the form has a shadow to make it look more stark against the white background making the form elements stand out a lot more. 
  - On the right hand side of the form are different form elements for the user to fill out, the required aspects of the form are the name, email and phone number boxes to ensure they can get in contact. The other elements are additional feedback boxes, one asking how they would like to help giving three options; donate, volunteer or both and the other element is a textarea box which allows the user to leave a comment. This creates a closer bond for the user as it makes them feel they are having a say and an impact on the cause of the website, Protect Our Habitats.
