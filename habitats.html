            <h2>The Rainforest </h2>
            <p>
                The ecosystem in the Rainforest is a vital environment to protect as it may only take up 2% of the
                Earth’s surface area however it provides nearly 50% of the flora and fauna with habitat. It plays a
                vital role on Earth as close to 20% of the World’s oxygen is from the Rainforest and can be known as the
                ‘lungs of the planet’. Additionally, it is key to regulating the climate conditions of the planet as the
                ecosystems help to protect against different natural disasters such as floods, erosions and droughts.
                There are many reasons why the Rainforest has been so sought over and destroyed as there are many
                different wants for human use and consumption that are found there, for example, coffee, cocoa powder,
                vanilla, timber and black pepper as well as different sources of food and medicine. The span of the
                Rainforest habitat used to accumulate up to six million square miles, however due to deforestation that
                has decreased down to almost three million.
            </p>
            <p>There are many different types of flora and fauna found in the Rainforest which include orchids,
                Mountain Gorilla, Blue Morpho Butterfly, Poison Dart Frog, Green Anaconda and many more. There are also
                tribes still living in the Rainforest where it provides all the needs they need to survive including
                water, food and shelter.
            </p>
            <p>
                To help protect this special habitat, there are many steps that can be taken which include donating to
                different charities actively fighting against the deforestation taking place, planting more trees where
                there used to be patches of forest, parks could be found and started to protect the surroundings to
                ensure they are protected and cannot be touched by humans to be destroyed, and lastly, to expand your
                knowledge on the world we live in and keep up-to-date with different news on what is happening in the
                Rainforest.
