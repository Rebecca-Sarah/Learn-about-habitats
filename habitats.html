            <h2>The Rainforest </h2>
            <p>
                The ecosystem in the Rainforest is a vital environment to protect as it may only take up 2% of the
                Earth’s surface area however it provides nearly 50% of the flora and fauna with habitat. It plays a
                vital role on Earth as close to 20% of the World’s oxygen is from the Rainforest and can be known as the
                ‘lungs of the planet’. Additionally, it is key to regulating the climate conditions of the planet as the
                ecosystems help to protect against different natural disasters such as floods, erosions and droughts.
                There are many reasons why the Rainforest has been so sought over and destroyed as there are many
                different wants for human use and consumption that are found there, for example, coffee, cocoa powder,
                vanilla, timber and black pepper as well as different sources of food and medicine. The span of the
                Rainforest habitat used to accumulate up to six million square miles, however due to deforestation that
                has decreased down to almost three million.
            </p>
            <p>There are many different types of flora and fauna found in the Rainforest which include orchids,
                Mountain Gorilla, Blue Morpho Butterfly, Poison Dart Frog, Green Anaconda and many more. There are also
                tribes still living in the Rainforest where it provides all the needs they need to survive including
                water, food and shelter.
            </p>
            <p>
                To help protect this special habitat, there are many steps that can be taken which include donating to
                different charities actively fighting against the deforestation taking place, planting more trees where
                there used to be patches of forest, parks could be found and started to protect the surroundings to
                ensure they are protected and cannot be touched by humans to be destroyed, and lastly, to expand your
                knowledge on the world we live in and keep up-to-date with different news on what is happening in the
                Rainforest.

            <h2> The African Savanna</h2>
            <p>The African Savannas are grasslands that are flat which are home to many
                different plants and trees
                which provide food, shelter and water to the many different species of animals that live there. On
                the video there are many different animals shown, detailing what their role is in their habitat to
                help the eco-system thrive. The animals living there have adapted to be able to survive the
                conditions that they may face which includes having a shortage of water and food. Many of the
                animals migrate or hibernate until the season has finished and they would be able to find different
                sources for their needs again. Camouflage is another way animals have adapted to be able to protect
                themselves from different predators that are roaming the grounds.
            </p>
            <p>The African Savanna can be protected by being respected by the humans visiting it and ensuring
                they
                are doing the most to conserve the land and the living things that are there. There are also
                many
                different restoration projects that people can volunteer with to help them reach their target of
                making the Savanna a safe place and ensure the damage that has been done won’t keep affecting
                the Savanna in the future.

            <h2>Kelp Forest</h2>
            <p>Kelp forests are made up of large brown algae that are found in the ocean, this ecosystem is usually
                found in cold shallow areas of water that are full of nutrients, they start their growth at the bottom
                of the seafloor and grow until the surface of the water, kelp can look like tall plants, hence where it
                got the name of a forest. Some of the species growing in a kelp forest can grow up to forty-five metres
                underwater which makes it the perfect place for shelter for different animals and marine species. There
                are many different species that use kelp forests for necessities such as shelter, food and protection,
                fish and other sea live use kelp forests for shelter especially during storms and from predators.
                Different birds such as seagulls and great blue herons and shore birds often use kelp forests for
                feeding. Kelp forests also are vital for protecting the shoreline from severe winds and storms as the
                forests help fight against erosion.
            </p>
            <p>There are many different factors that are threatening the habitat of a kelp forest, one of which includes
                global warming as the waters are rising in temperature that means that the cold water isn’t bringing in
                the correct nutrients needed to keep the algae healthy, which leads to the kelp becoming weaker and not
                surviving. Another threat to life in the kelp forests are destructive fishing practices which can ruin
                the life that is being supported within the forests under the waterline.
            </p>
            <p>Fortunately, there are different ways we can help the population of kelp forests, which is to bring more
                attention to what is happening involving different fishing practices and changing methods to ensure the
                least amount of damage to our surroundings is happening, this should in turn allow the 5% of kelp
                forests left to have time to recover. Reforestation has been another method to have been used and it
                seen to be one of the best ways to restore different habitats and lost biodiversity under the water’s
                surface.

        <div id="arctic">
            <h2>The Arctic</h2>
            <p>The Arctic is home to many fascinating creatures that live both above and under the sea that have adapted
                over time to live in such a cold climate. It is made up of glaciers, icebergs, frozen fresh water and
                ice. The glaciers and the icebergs in the Arctic make up 20% of the Earth’s supply of fresh water. The
                animals that live in the Arctic include seals, sea lions, walruses, sharks, crabs, baleen whales, orcas
                and narwhales. The animals that live there are a range of carnivores and herbivores, and get everything
                they need including shelter, food and water within their ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>The Arctic Oceans can very easily be under attack as they do not belong to a nation which means there is
                no protection status around them which makes them open to a range of dangerous activities that can
                include poaching. It is hoped that a strong Global Ocean Treaty will be presented which will lead to the
                Arctic Ocean becoming a sanctuary and somewhere safe for the creatures that live within the habitat.
